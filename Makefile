# The lock, flattened to `name==version` lines for GuardDog to read. This is
# NOT the GuardDog cache — that is machine-wide and lives wherever
# `ai_common.security.guarddog_cached.cache_path()` points, normally
# ~/.cache/guarddog-cached/. This file is an input, written before each sweep
# and removed by the EXIT trap after it.
#
# Repo-local on purpose. It used to be a fixed path in /tmp, shared by every
# project on the machine: the wrapper reads the requirements file once at
# startup, so a second repo exporting between this repo's export and its read
# would make this sweep scan the *other* repo's dependencies and report a pass
# on them — silently, since every line in it is a legitimate package.
#
# The remaining hole is deliberate. Two sweeps at once *in the same repo* still
# share this path, and neither the rename nor the move fixes that. Don't do
# that; they would be fighting over uv.lock as well.

# Tier 2: GuardDog static analysis on every locked dep. Wrapped by the

# packages.

# `uv export --frozen` is load-bearing: without it, an export from a lock that
# has drifted from pyproject.toml re-resolves and REWRITES uv.lock, so a
# recipe that reads as read-only would edit the lockfile and then scan a
# resolution nobody chose. It would also let `verify` audit the committed lock
# in tier 1 and scan a different one in tier 2. Verified 2026-08-11: adding a
# dependency to pyproject.toml and running the un-frozen export rewrote
# uv.lock and pulled the new package into the scanned set.
