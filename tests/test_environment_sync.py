"""The virtual environment must stay coupled to `uv.lock`.

Both supply-chain gate tiers read `uv.lock`: `osv-scanner` parses it directly,
and the GuardDog sweep scans whatever `uv export` flattens out of it. Neither
looks at `.venv`. A package that is installed but not locked is therefore
invisible to both tiers while still being importable by the application and by
these tests — it is scanned by nobody and runs anyway.

That is not hypothetical. Two unrelated drifts were found by hand on
2026-08-16: `olefile` and `python-oxmsg`, left behind by an `upgrade-safe`
candidate the gate had rejected, and `httpx2`, `httpcore2` and `truststore`,
pulled in by an extras-installing command. Nothing reported either one. Both
sources are now closed, but this test exists because the next source will be a
different one.

`uv sync --check` is uv's own answer to the question, so the comparison is
deliberately not re-implemented here: it evaluates environment markers, knows
the project installs itself into its own environment, and reports a venv that
is missing packages as readily as one carrying extras. Measured 2026-08-16 —
exit 0 when synchronised, exit 1 in both drift directions, and it modifies
neither the environment nor the lock.
